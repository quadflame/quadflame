# Hey there! 👋
I'm **quadflame**, a student who **really loves** to code. In fact, I've been doing this almost every day since **April 2022**. 🤯 Most of this time was been spent creating 🛠️ plugins for Minecraft servers. One time I even contributed 💪 to GitHub **167 days in a row**!

## 🍿 My Favourites
![Favourite Tools](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=java,kotlin,mysql,maven,idea,github,bash,cloudflare,ae)

After **much experimenting** 🧪 with a vast range of tech, these are definitely some of my favourite!

<sub>**After Effects?!?** Yes, I used to edit [Youtube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/@quadflame) 💗</sub>

## ✨ Goals
In the future, I plan to continue learning new tech, some of which being:
- **Kotlin** 🚀 to add a **modern twist** to my Java proficiency
- **Go** 🎉 to gain a deeper understanding of concurrency with coroutines

## 👓 Appendix
